Hey! my Name is Nathan Gillis

I personally think this is a great idea. i love games as well and incorporating math and data into them has always been enjoyable.
I do not know much about the game itself, but I would love to help with learning the in's and outs. I am also taking classes in statistics and probability, 
so those might be aspects we want to include in the project as well. 

As for the Business, i would love to take this to the next level, in creating a front end for the app and looking into business options.
I do however feel that a free game with ads would have the greatest returns. The biggest problem we would likely face would be the licensing.
I am not sure if we would be able to contact the company and get the license, but we have options of attempting to contact them, or branching 
off and creating our own game down the road. in addition, simply being a helper takes information and shares it with a player. 
To translate this into a game would require more AI use and interaction. 

Overall, I think this sounds like a great project
and i would love to get on board.
