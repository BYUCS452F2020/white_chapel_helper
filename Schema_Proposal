Proposed Tables
---------------

Connections - In Letters from Whitechapel, the player who plays Jack the Ripper moves unseen along a map of nodes. This table will contain the list of all nodes (To_Node) that can be reached in one step from any starting node (From_Node). It has a composite key because all nodes connect to at least two other nodes (there are no dead ends).

  - Connections(From_Node, To_Node)
    * Foreign Key: From_Node and To_Node reference Alleys
    
Alleys - This table is similar to Connections, but instead lists all nodes that Jack can reach from any given node via a game mechanic called an “alley.” Using an alley, Jack can move to any node bordering any city block that his current node is adjacent to.

  - Alleys(From_Node, To_Node)
    * Foreign Key: From_Node and To_Node reference Connections
    
Investigations - Jack’s opponents play as constables who can investigate a node to determine whether it has been visited by Jack at some point during the current round. If so, it is said that that node contains a clue. This table keeps track of which nodes have been investigated, what turn they were investigated on, and whether that node contained a clue at that time. This table has a composite key because a node can be investigated multiple times per round and it is useful to distinguish each separate investigation by the turn on which it occurred.

  - Investigations(Node, turn_investigated, Has_Clue)
    * Foreign Key: Node and Turn_Investigated reference Jack_Moves
    * Foreign Key: Node and Turn_Investigated reference Possible_Locations
    
Jack_Moves (normal, normal, alley...) - This table contains a row for each of Jack’s moves. Each row contains the node he moved to, the turn number, and whether he used a movement ability that allows him to move to a node other than the nodes one space away from him on that turn. For example, Jack could use an alley to move many nodes away from his current node. On turn zero, the Destination_Node will be Jack’s starting location.

  - Jack_Moves(Destination_Node, Turn, Move_Type )
    * Foreign Key: Destination_Node and Turn reference Investigations
    * Foreign Key: Destination_Node and Turn reference Investigations
    
Possible_Locations - This table is of direct interest to the constables. It contains a row for each of Jack’s possible node locations for each turn. For example, selecting all rows from this table where turn is equal to two would tell you which nodes Jack could have reached by turn two.

  - Possible_Locations(Turn, Node)
    * Foreign Key: Node and Turn reference Jack_Moves
    * Foreign Key: Node and Turn reference Investigations
