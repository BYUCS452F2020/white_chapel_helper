# white_chapel_helper
This repo creates and manages a database that helps users win a popular board game "Letters from White Chapel".

Business
Eventually, I would love to create a front end app and make money off of ads. 

Legal
When we have a front end app, we would register ourselves as a business. We would either need to get licensing permission from the White Chapel game, or use a generic non branded language. 

Technical
We will be using 3 SQL tables for the first part of the project, and hopefully a Graph NoSQL Database for the second part of the project.
