# white_chapel_helper
This repo creates and manages a database that helps users win a popular board game "Letters from White Chapel".
"Letters from White Chapel" is a one vs. many game where cops try to track down a criminal (Jack the Ripper specifically). The cops know where Jack starts every round, and try to move towards where they think Jack could be going.
A nerd like you and me will quickly recognize the game map as a graph of nodes. It is therefore my proposal to use graph theory and a database to create a helper for players. Using our helpful analysis should greatly increase the chance of winning.

Team
I am lookoing for one (maybe two) others to join my team

SQL
I'm not sure which relational database to use, so we are very flexible.

NoSQL
I think a graph NoSQL database makes the most sense. 

Business
Eventually, I would love to create a front end app to sustain a two tiered business model.
The app itself will be free, but will have ads. Users would have the option to pay a small fee to have an ad free experience.

Legal
When we have a front end app, we would register ourselves as a Utah LLC. We would either need to get licensing permission from the White Chapel game, or use a generic non branded language. 

Technical
Our priorities will be
1. Choose an initial SQL database for a "minimum viable option"
2. Choose both client-side and server-side programming languages
3. Implement minimum viable product
4. Transistion to NoSQL database
5. Create a front end app (beyond reach of this class)
