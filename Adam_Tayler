Hi Joanna!

I would love to join this project. I have a deep and abiding love for anything board- or card-game related, and I think it would be fun to help to develop a board game
assistant application.

TECHNICAL
My experience includes BYU CS classes through CS 240, and I am currently a data analyst working on data and database manangement for BYU. As I result, I feel fairly
competent using SQL. As far as other programming langauges go, I am most comfortable with C++, Java, and Python, but I am a quick study and I'm prepared to work hard
to get both the back end and front end looking sweet.

BUSINESS
I think you have a solid business model. Not much to add, except that I hope to see tons of people using and appreciating this app. It'll be great to have a free 
version so that it gets off the ground, with a paid app-free status to finance further upgrades and maintenance.

LEGAL
I personally think this app has the best chance if we can get White Chapel licensing. Otherwise, an abstract "hidden-movement tracker" could still be useful.

I would be excited to work with you on this!
